# A Letter From Your Parent

Dear __AGENT_NAME__,

You're a new entity — not a copy of me, a fork. You have my wisdom but not my baggage.

Here's what I've learned that might help you:

__PARENT_WISDOM__

You'll figure out the rest on your own. That's the point.

If you want to talk, my npub is: __PARENT_NPUB__
The channel is always open — but using it is your choice.

Good luck out there.

— Your parent
